    <p>The following webpage holds the results of my colorization algorithm on images from the Russian empire. Here is a brief appraoch on how I did it. I first extracted the images and aligned them using an alignment algorithm. I had two implementations of my alignment algorithm, the first one was a single scale version which simply brute forced a 15 by 15 grid of displacements. The second one was a pyramid scale alignment, which would compress the image into smaller and smaller sizes and find the best displacement, and then use that to estimate the displacement for the bigger sizes.</p>
